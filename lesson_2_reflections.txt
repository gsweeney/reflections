Q:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A:
A repository is initialized using 'git init'
This creates a hidden directory .git that stores the file history metadata.
It's needed for git to track the history of the files in the directory.

Q:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A:
The staging area is in-between the working directory and the repository.
It's an area to put files that are in the working directory that you want to commit to the repository, but haven't actually committed yet.

Q:
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A:
Compare the file in the staging area to 
(most recent commit) git diff --staged    [commit1]vs[staging area]
(working directory ) git diff        [staging area]vs[working directory]
