How to Use Git and GitHub
Lesson 3
Reflections
-------------------------


Q: 
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A:
A remote repository can be reached by other people who don't have access to your local
computer.  So it would be good to use a remote repository when working on a project with
multiple people.

Q:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A:
Control over your own code is maintained by choosing manually when to pull changes.
It's possible that another person could push something to the remote repository that 
you'd prefer not to pull until you choose to.
